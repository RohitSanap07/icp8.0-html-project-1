    <p><b><i>The original Renaissance Man, Leonardo is identified with genius,<br> not only for masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa (the title for which <br>has entered the language as a superlative), The Last Supper and The<br> Lady with an Ermine, but also for his drawings of technologies<br> (aircraft, tanks, automobile) that were five hundred years in the future.</i></b></p><hr>

    <br>
    <p><b><i>One the greatest artists in history, this Dutch Master is responsible for <br>masterworks such as The Night Watch and Doctor Nicolaes Tulp's <br>Demonstration of the Anatomy of the Arm. But he is particularly know<br> for portraits in which he demonstrated an uncanny ability to evoke the<br> innermost thoughts of his subjects including himself through the play <br>of facial expression and the fall of light across the sitter's features.</i></b></p><hr>

    <div>
    <h2>3.VERMEER</h2>

    <p><b><i>Remarkably, Vermeer was largely forgotten for two centuries before his<br> rediscovery in the 19th century. Since then, he’s been recognized as one<br> of art history’s most important figures, an artist capable of rendering works<br> of uncanny beauty. Many have argued the Vermeer used a camera <br>obscura—an early form of projector—and certainly the soft blur he employs <br>appears to foreshadow photorealism. But the most important aspect of his <br>work is how it represents light as a tangible substance.</i></b></p><hr>
